# 🐍 Console Mini Projects in Python

Welcome to my repository! 🚀 Here, I'll be adding small console-based projects that I’m developing while learning Python. Each project is designed to reinforce different fundamental concepts, such as data structures, programming logic, the standard library, and more.

## 🚀 How to Run the Projects

To run any mini project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/Bleer30/python-programs.git
       cd python-programs
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the project you want to run.

3. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
       python script_name.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Standard Python libraries (if any external libraries are required, they will be mentioned in each project).

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

The main goals of this repository are:

- ✅ Practice and improve my Python skills.
- ✅ Explore key programming concepts through small practical projects.
- ✅ Share my progress and receive feedback from the community.
